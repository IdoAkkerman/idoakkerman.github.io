#idoakkerman.github.io

The personal website of [Ido Akkerman](https://idoakkerman.github.io/)

## Building
Go to the base source directory and run:
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build --lsi
```
or

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

In the later case the website is hosted [locally](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

## Template

The website uses the  [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
